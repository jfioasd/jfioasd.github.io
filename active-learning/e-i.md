Elaborative interrogation means that, when presented with factual information, students respond to ‘why’ questions or 'how' questions. Doing this helps them make links to existing knowledge.

To use elaborative interrogation, we can either simply ask why, or rephrase a statement as a why question.

An elaborative interrogation question should build on the information in the statement, instead of asking for obvious facts (which do not require any thinking to answer).
