In their book, "The Adult Student’s Guide to Survival & Success," Al Siebert and Mary Karr advise:

> Imagine that you are the instructor and have to write some questions that will test the class on the material covered.

How to create a practice test?

While you're taking notes in class, write a "Q" in the margin beside material that would make a good test question.

Siebert and Karr suggest that as you read your textbooks and lecture notes, jot down questions that occur to you. You’ll be creating your own practice test as you study. 

When you’re ready, take the test without checking your notes or books. Make the practice as real as possible, including giving partial answers when you aren’t sure and limiting the time allowed.
