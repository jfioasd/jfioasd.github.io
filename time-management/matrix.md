They can do this because they understand the difference between urgent and important.

* ‘Urgent’ tasks demand your immediate attention, but whether you actually give them that attention may or may not matter.

* 'Important' tasks matter, and not doing them may have serious consequences for you or others.

This distinction between urgent and important is the key to prioritising your time and your workload, whether at work, at home or when studying.

It enables you to work out what to do first, and what can be left either until later, or not done at all.

Using a grid like the priority matrix below can help you to organise your tasks into their appropriate categories:

|Importance|High Urgency|Low Urgency|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|High|Do First| Do next (or schedule)|
|Low|Do later (or delegate)|Don't do|

To use the priority matrix, it is best to review your tasks on a daily basis. Each day, ask yourself:

* Which of my tasks needs doing within the next 48 hours? (Those are the ‘Urgent’ tasks.)

* Of the urgent tasks, which ones are more important?



* Of the non-urgent tasks, which ones are more important?

Again, it is a good idea to list them in order, rather than giving them an absolute distinction.
