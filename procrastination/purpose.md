Lack of purpose is the biggest reason for procrastination.

Purpose lends a meaning and direction to our life. Purpose dominates our actions and behavior.

How would you find a purpose to your life?  Ask yourself the following:

* What is it that matters to me the most?
* What is it that I desire?
* What are my goals?
* Who do I want to help?
* Why am I doing what I'm doing?
* Who will benefit?
* What do I care about?

Asking yourself these questions, will help you figure out your true purpose. Remember to write them down, and remind yourself of the answers every day. Before you know it, you'll be motivated to take action everyday without fail, because you now have a "why" behind your actions.
