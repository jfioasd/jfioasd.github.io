## Too much thinking, not enough Action

It's so easy to think about doing something and even simpler to put it off until tomorrow. But doing that just guarantees you'll never do it. If you put it off today, you'll put it off tomorrow, and the process will continue.

In fact, thinking about doing the thing you know you need to do, doesn't motivate you to take action. It just keeps you thinking about it.

So the solution is simple. Stop thinking about it so much, instead act upon it! You will realise that doing rather than just thinking is more productive.
