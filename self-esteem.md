Self-esteem is what you believe about yourself.

It includes how you feel about yourself, or the opinion you have about yourself.

It is about how we value ourselves, and our perceptions about who we are and what we are capable of.

Low self-esteem often starts in childhood, perhaps with a belief that you were unable to live up to expectations. However, it can also be the result of adult experiences such as a difficult relationship, either personal or at work.

There are a number of ways in which you can improve your self-esteem.

* **Become more aware of negative thoughts.** Learn to identify the distorted thoughts that are impacting your self-worth. You can choose not to believe them, or change them into more positive thoughts. This can be done during meditation.
* **Use positive self-talk.** Practice reciting positive affirmations to yourself.
* **Practice self-compassion.** Practice forgiving yourself for past mistakes and move forward by accepting all parts of yourself.
