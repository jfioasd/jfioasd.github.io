Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself, or the opinion you have about yourself.

It is about how we value ourselves, and our perceptions about who we are and what we are capable of.

There are many reasons why someone might have low self-esteem. However, it often starts in childhood, perhaps with a feeling that you were unable to live up to expectations. It can also be the result of adult experiences such as a difficult relationship, either personal or at work.

There are a number of ways in which you can improve your self-esteem.

* **Become more aware of negative thoughts.** Learn to identify the distorted thoughts that are impacting your self-worth.
* **Challenge negative thinking patterns.** When you find yourself engaging in negative thinking, try countering those thoughts with more realistic and/or positive ones, or put them aside.
* **Use positive self-talk.** Practice reciting positive affirmations to yourself.
* **Practice self-compassion.** Practice forgiving yourself for past mistakes and move forward by accepting all parts of yourself.
