I think [this](https://hbr.org/2021/06/train-your-brain-to-be-more-creative) article
is the best article I could find on the topic of creativity.

There are 4 points in that article:
* **Meditate**.
  * Meditation clears up unnecessary thoughts in your mind, making it easier to clarify thoughts and observe things.
  * Besides, it is an exercise that engages your entire brain. (And creativity requires engaging both sides of your brain.)
* **Exercise**.
  * Exercise is a great tool to release stress and pain.
  * Through exercise, you will have a calmer and more accepting state of mind that makes it easier to generate creative thoughts.
* **Engaging with nature**.
  * Engaging with nature can elevate our moods and spark imagination.
  * It also has a significant benefit on emotional health and mental health.
  * Even a walk in the park would have a similar benefit.
* **Engaging with different-minded people**.
  * Engaging with different people challenges your stereotypes and forces your brain to work harder.
  * Different opinions allow us to see more possibilities, and make better decisions.
